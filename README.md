# React Mini Projects

This repository contains several mini projects that I developed while deepening my understanding of React. The focus of these projects is on mastering React hooks, routing, Context API, and the Redux Toolkit.

## Projects Included

### 1. ðŸŒˆ Background Changer
A simple app to dynamically change the background color of a webpage using React hooks like `useState`.

### 2. ðŸ’± Currency Converter
An application that converts currency values using real-time exchange rates fetched from an API. This project demonstrates the use of `useEffect` for data fetching and `useState` for state management.

### 3. ðŸ”’ Password Generator
A tool to generate secure passwords based on user-defined criteria (length, characters, symbols). This app demonstrates state and form handling in React.

### 4. ðŸŒ“ Theme Switcher
A project that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes. Implemented using `useContext` and `useReducer` to manage global state for theme switching.

### 5. ðŸ“‹ Todo App (Redux & Context API)
A full-featured Todo application with two implementations:
- **Redux version**: State management is done using the Redux Toolkit (`store`, `slice`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`).
- **Context API version**: Demonstrates state management using React's Context API and `useReducer` for managing complex state logic.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Functional components, hooks, and routing.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For global state management in some projects.
- **Context API**: Used for global state management in other projects.
- **CSS**: For styling the UI elements.

## Learning Outcomes
Through these mini-projects, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience with:
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useCallback`, `useId`)
- React Router for routing between components
- State management using Redux Toolkit and Context API
- Global and local state handling in functional components
- API integration and handling asynchronous data
- Building interactive and user-friendly UIs

## Future Enhancements
- Add unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Implement TypeScript for type safety
- Expand each project with additional features

## Getting Started

To run any of these projects locally, clone the repository and follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
